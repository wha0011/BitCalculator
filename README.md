A fancy calculator pretty much.

Its *original* purpose was to serve as a bitcalculator or sorts. Something to allow you to quickly calculate bitmath on numbers. Can show the binary value of a number as a byte, a ushort, a uint and a ulong. Can also function as a caulculator.

This is useful if you have a program that relies on *bitbashing* as it shows you the binary value of the numbers you are processing, as well as what the result of bitwise operations would be on said number. The calculator side of this by default calculates with ulongs, but by specifying *doum* before an equation, it will calculate it as a double.

This app can also be useful if you are handling *hex*, and don't know how to read it. The app can convert hex, e.g. #ff, to a ulong, 255. You can also type in *hrgb* ffffff to find the rgb value of a hex colour.

You can customize these functions to suit yourself, as you can define custom variables with *#define*, *#defunc*, *var*. More information in the WIKI

One of the more recent tools added to this app is the ability to use networking tools. You can use it similiar to CMD, by using *ipconfig*, as well as *nslookup*. You can also test how your servers/clients will interact using this app. There is an inbuilt function where you can quickly start sending/recieving from a server/client. This can be used either as a programming tool or something for begginers to use to understand networking.

**The app's general purpose is to act as a tool for developers, but has some features purely designed to play around with**
